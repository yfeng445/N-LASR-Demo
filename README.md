# NLASR-Demo

NLASR stands for Non-Linear Adaptive Style Rotation Model. It is a stock selection model that Deutsche Bank Research has been publishing on since 2012. The model uses machine learning to aggregate over 110 alphas and invest in thousands of stocks across the globe.

It is inspired by a technique called ‘adaptive boosting’, which means it is not a stand alone technique but it can be used in conjunction with many other types of learning algorithms to improve performance. What you are doing is creating a strong predictor from many weak predictors. Specifically, you’re boosting the importance of the times your learning model gets it wrong, so that it can focus more and more on the times when you normally get it wrong.
